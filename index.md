### NEATO: Navigating the Gauntlet

<img src="images/paths.JPG?raw=true"/>

Wrote a program to autonomously pilot a simulated NEATO robot from a defined starting
position and heading to a predetermined goal, through/around given obstacles. To do this, I implemented gradient descent, treating the goal as a sink and the obstacles as sources. Switching the sources/sinks would also work with slightly modified code.<br/>

### Avionics Payload: Olin Rocketry

We had the goal of competing in the 2020 IREC Space Port America competition, but like many other things, it was cancelled due to COVID-19. I guess we'll just have to wait until 2021! As Sensing Lead, I was involved with many different aspects of the Avionics payload of our rocket. I started out the 2019-2020 year working on long distance radio communication, transitioned to apogee detection, then worked a bit on flight computer design using KiCad. Right before we got kicked off of campus we managed to finish assembling a prototype flight computer, which consists of a micro-controller board (a Metro Express), a long-range radio module, an altimeter, accelerometer, and GPS module all working together to track in-flight motion. 


### Bridge of Doom - Quantitative Engineering Analysis Final Project

Simulated a NEATO robot traversing a dangerous volcanic bridge using an open loop control system. The centerline of the bridge was given by a parametric curve. Used MATLAB and its ROS toolbox.<br/>
