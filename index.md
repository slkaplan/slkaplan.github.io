Simulated a NEATO robot traversing a dangerous volcanic bridge using an open loop control system. The centerline of the bridge was given by a parametric curve. Used MATLAB and its ROS toolbox.<br/>

### NEATO: Navigating the Gauntlet

<img src="images/paths.JPG?raw=true"/>

Wrote a program to autonomously pilot a simulated NEATO robot from a defined starting
position and heading to a predetermined goal, through/around given obstacles. To do this, I implemented gradient descent, treating the goal as a sink and the obstacles as sources. Switching the sources/sinks would also work with slightly modified code.<br/>
