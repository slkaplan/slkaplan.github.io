### Bridge of Doom - Quantitative Engineering Analysis Final Project

<img src="images/bridgeofdoomThumbnail.PNG?raw=true"/>

The goal for this project was to have a simulated NEATO robot traverse a
dangerous volcanic bridge using an open loop control system. This was accomplished mainly through MATLAB and its ROS toolbox. The centerline of the
bridge the NEATO robot had to traverse is defined by the following parametric
curve:

r(u) = 4 ∗ [0.3960 cos(2.65(u + 1.4))i − 0.99 sin(u + 1.4)j].(u ∈ [0, 3.2])
